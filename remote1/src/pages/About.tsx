              Hello! My name is Bappy and I enjoy creating things that live on
              the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2020
              when one of my friend showed something like, he has written his
              name of a top programmer‘s profile. I just saw and shocked, I
              thought a lot about HTML &amp; CSS!
              <br />
              <br />
              Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
              advertising agency and a start-up company. My main focus these
              days was building accessible, inclusive products and digital
              experiences at HalcyonBD, ShafaCare, WebX Global Ltd., and SWAP.
